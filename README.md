The application is composed of of two parts:

- The mock back-end app in the `mock-server/` directory
- The mock front-end app located in the `clinet/` directory

## Getting Started

In a terminal window, navigate to the repo's `mock-server/` directory and run the following to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn add
```

Open another terminal window, navigate to the repo's `client/` directory and run the following to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn add
```

then, run the application on development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Wait the mocked-server run at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
